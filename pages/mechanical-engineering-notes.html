    <h1>Introduction to Mechanical Engineering</h1>

    <p>Mechanical engineering is one of the broadest fields in engineering, focusing on the design, analysis, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It applies principles of physics, materials science, and mathematics to create systems that solve real-world problems.</p>

    <p>Key areas within mechanical engineering include thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, materials science, kinematics, and mechanical design. These principles are applied in industries such as automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, robotics, and energy.</p>

    <p>One foundational concept is Newton’s Laws of Motion, which govern how objects move and interact with forces. Engineers use these laws to calculate stress, strain, and load-bearing capacity of mechanical structures.</p>

    <p>Computer-aided design (CAD) software is widely used to create 3D models of parts and assemblies, while simulation tools like FEA (Finite Element Analysis) help predict how a design will perform under physical forces.</p>

    <p>As mechanical systems become more complex, the field increasingly overlaps with electrical engineering, computer science, and materials engineering — especially in areas like mechatronics, automation, and sustainable energy solutions.</p>

    <p>Mechanical engineers must also consider environmental impact, material efficiency, and life-cycle sustainability when developing new systems or improving existing ones.</p>
